- Finish landing / abt me page (Hi, my name is...)
- do projects page layout template with 2 blank filler "projects"
- make socials button do the animation
- link all socials to socials tab
    - (spotify, insta, flickr, linkdin, github, etc)
- make template for the photography page
- mayb consolidate the "favorites" + "music" tabs into one "Media" tab
    - then figure out what new tab to add in one of their places
    - (prefer the look of navbar w/ 5 tabs vs w/ 4 tabs)
- implement the animation for switching between different content page views
    - ("erasing" / "redrawing")

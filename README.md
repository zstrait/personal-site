## Things I'm Planning to Implement:
### Landing Page:
- Prob open up with some kind of nav menu, slightly lower center of center of screen
- nav menu will show options to go to all the diff pages I add to the site
- the 'projects' section should be the most easily seen/selectable option

### Projects Page:
- might integrate this directly into landing page

### Favorites Page:
- mayb something containing lists of all my favorite things from different categories
    - movies
    - books
    - albums
    - songs
    - games

### Music / Listening to page: 
- could contain small bi/weekly updates of songs/albums i've been enjoying recently
